## 👋 Hey there, I'm Ciaran 
I'm an aspiring developer! Currently developing my skills in front-end development but eager to explore back-end technologies and frameworks.


## About Me 👀
I’m interested in... 

Gaming :space_invader: I'm a big fan of singleplayer RPG's [Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring) :japanese_goblin: being my most rewarding experience.
But i also enjoy FPS games like [CS](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2) :gun: and
did i mention 2D Sandbox games like [Terraria](https://terraria.org) :joystick:
i also enjoy mountian biking :bike:	(when its sunny :sun_with_face:)

Currently, I'm trying to improve my skills in front-end development, but i understand it takes a lot of practice, trails and errors to improve your skills, but i will get there eventually! I'm also super interested into checking out back-end technologies and more frameworks once i understand the basic ones first!
